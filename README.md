## 🧠 Projects I've Built


### 🏥 Clinic Chatbot Agent  
Designed and implemented an AI agent that interacts with doctors and patients.  
→ Used FastAPI + LangChain + tool calling + prompt engineering with memory and retrieval.

### 📨 Text Classification System for Emalls  
Built an NLP pipeline to auto-categorize product titles/descriptions.  
→ Used traditional ML + transformer-based models.

### 🔍 Image-based Visual Search  
Collaborated on a visual product search tool using embeddings.  
→ Focused on data preprocessing, vector storage, and FAISS retrieval.

### 🧠 SQL-to-Knowledge Graph Converter  
Developed a pipeline to replicate structured SQL data into graph-based knowledge representations.
